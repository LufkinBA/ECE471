ECE471 Fall 2021 -- HW7

Name: Blake Lufkin

The number (written in sharpie) on the bag containing
your MCP3008/TMP36: 14


4. Describe your something cool:
	Displays a warning message on prompt if the temperature exceeds a certain
	value

5. a.	This is a hard real-time task as if the deadline is missed,
		people may die
   b.	This is a soft real-time task as the result is less useful as time
		passes but poses no real threat or loss of data.
   c.	This is a Firm real-time task as if the refresh rate is any lower then
		frames might be missed or data lost.
   d.	I2C is less hardware, i.e. less wires required
   e.	Less power consumption as there are no pull up resistors required
   f.	It would not work out of the box as the long cable would provide over 
		10nF of a capacitive load and would cause oscillation.
   g.	This could be a problem if Linux had to do anything in the background.
		It can be done but the timing couldnt be gauranteed all the time

6. a.	It seems to output nothing
   b.	write error: No space left on device
   c.	Could be usefull if you want to transmit all zeros without typing
		that in code.
   d.	without checking, I think this has a collection of random digits/characters
